			<h2>A host is blocked but I can still connect to it</h2>
			
			<p>Once Vihoma has updated its hosts list or you have manually added one, it is necessary to restart the operating system or your network's manager so the changes can take effect.</p>
			<p>If you opt for restarting your network instead of your computer, you may do it following these steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you are using Windows, open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run this command:
					<ul>
						<li>ipconfig /flushdns</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If you are using GNU/Linux, open a Terminal and run with root privileges:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Debian/Ubuntu</strong> sudo service network-manager restart</li>
						<li><strong>Linux Mint</strong> sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean start</li>
						<li><strong>Linux with</strong> systemd: sudo systemctl restart network.service</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If you are using MacOS X, open a Terminal and run:
					<ul>
						<li>sudo dscacheutil -flushcache;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>DNS Client</h2>
			<p>This is applicable only to Windows operating systems.</p>
			<p>The World Wide Web is composed of millions of computers distributed all around the world. In order to visit a webpage, the web browser needs to know where the page is located in that huge net. Just like people and ordinary mail, there are addresses that help us reach those external computers, which are named IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. As they are a secuence of numbers difficult to remember, they where replaced by Domain Names, which were texts easily rememberable by humans and which were translated by computers to IPs. This was long ago done locally (on each computer), but the huge expansion of the internet made it impossible to register every new webpage so this was externalized.</p>
			<p>Windows has a built-in registry of domains which is no longer needed, and you can just disable it in most of the cases. If it is enabled, you may have to wait several minutes at Windows startup to have internet access. Once it is loaded, you can safely surf the internet.</p>

		<article id="validIP">
			<h2>Valid IPs</h2>
			<p>You can add custom hosts which will be redirected to a specific address. That address can be either IPv4 or IPv6, and has to follow these rules:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> If IPv4, it has to be formed by 4 groups of numbers from 0 to 255 separated by points. Example:
				<ul>
					<li>192.168.0.255</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li> If IPv6, it has to formed by 8 groups of characters which can be numbers from 0 to 9, letters from a to f and capital letters A to F. Example:
				<ul>
					<li>2001:0db8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7334</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here are the patterns used in the program to check if an IP is valid:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>\A(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d?\\d)(\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d?\d)){3}\z</li>
				<li>\\A(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\\d|[0-1]?\\d?\\d)(\\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\\d|[0-1]?\\d?\\d)){3}\\z</li>
				<li>\A((?:[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4}:){6,6})(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d?\\d)(\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d?\d)){3}\z</li>
				<li>\A((?:[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4}(?::[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4})*)?)::((?:[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4}(?::[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4})*)?)\z</li>
				<li>\A(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}:){7}[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}\z</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Running Vihoma at system startup</h2>

			<p>You can automate the system host management if you allow Vihoma to update its database at system startup. It will run silently and will keep your system up to date. This option is only available on Windows, but you can configure your specific operating system to run Vihoma at the startup. To do it silently, pass to the jar file the argument <i>quiet</i>.</p>
			
			<p>If you have enabled the program startup but it doesn't work, disable and enable it again. Do this each time you change the program location.</p>

		<article id="targetAddress">
			<h2>Custom target Address</h2>
			
			<p>By default, all the blocked hosts will be redirected to the address 0.0.0.0. You can change this if you want, for example, redirect everything to a personal server and log statistics about the domains which are being blocked in real time.</p>
		</article>
		
		<article id="shareDomains">
			<h2>Help Vihoma to block more domains</h2>
			
			<p>You can contribute to make the web safer if you allow us to collect your manually blocked hostnames. Each time you add a domain to the blocked list, it will be sent to the Vihoma central database. No personal information will be sent.</p>
